.pull-left[
.font90[

* R has always had a rich set of modeling tools that it inherited from S. For example, the formula interface has made it simple to specify potentially complex model structures.   

* _R has cutting edge models_. Many researchers in various domains use R as their primary computing environment and their work often results in R packages.

* _It is easy to port or link to other applications_. R doesn't try to be everything to everyone.

]
]

.pull-right[

However, there is a huge _consistency problem_. For example: 

.font90[

* There are two primary methods for specifying what terms are in a model. Not all models have both. 

* 99% of model functions automatically generate dummy variables. 

* Many package developers come from other languages (i.e. C) and omit common R idioms.

The `glmnet` model can be used to fit regularized generalized linear models with a mixture of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> penalties. 

We'll look at what happens when we get predictions for a regression model (i.e. numeric _Y_) as well as classification models where _Y_ has two or three categorical values.

---

# Numeric `glmnet` Predictions

The models shown below contain solutions for 3 regularization values ( $\lambda$ ), `0.01`, `0.1`, and `1`.

The predict method gives the results for all three at once (`r emojifont::emoji('+1')`).

```{r glmnet-reg}
new_x

predict(reg_mod, newx = new_x)
```

A matrix result and we will assume that the $\lambda$ values are in the same order as what we gave to the model fit function.

# What We Need

Unless you are doing a simple one-off data analysis, the lack of consistency between, and sometimes within, R packages can be very frustrating. 

If we could agree on a set of common conventions for interfaces, return values, and other components, everyone's life would be easier.

Once we agree on conventions, **two challenges** are: 

 * As of `r format(Sys.time(), "%b %Y")`, there are over `r pkgs`K R packages on CRAN. How do we "harmonize" these without breaking everything? 
 
 * How can we guide new R users (or people unfamiliar with R) in making good choices as they develop new modeling packages?

# Tidymodels 

`tidymodels` is a collection of modeling packages that live in the tidyverse that are guided by the same design principles.

Our goals for tidymodels are:

1. Encourage empirical validation and good methodology.

1. Smooth out diverse interfaces.

1. Build highly reusable infrastructure.

1. Enable a wider variety and combination of methodologies.

The `tidymodels` packages address the *retrospective* issues. We have also developed a set of principles and templates to solve the *prospective* issue by making it easy to create new modeling package that follow best practices.

# Selected Modeling Packages 

* [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as `lm()`, `nls()`, or `t.test()`, and turns them into tidy data frames.

* [`recipes`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. It can create model matrices that incorporate feature engineering, imputation, and other tools.

* [`rsample`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/) has infrastructure for _resampling_ data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated. 

* [`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/) gives us a unified modeling interface.

* [`tune`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/) has functions for grid search and sequential optimization of model parameters.

# Retrospective vs Prospective

These APIs focus on harmonizing _existing_ packages (i.e. the retrospective approach).

Ideally, package authors would create packages adhering to a set of principles which match our expectations as R users, and make it easy to incorporate their packages into the tidymodels ecosystem.

---

# Principles of Modeling Packages

We have [a set of _guidelines_](https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/) for making good modeling packages. For example:

* Support multiple expected interfaces (e.g. formula, x/y, recipe, etc). 

* The _user-facing interface_ should use the most intuitive data structures for the data (as opposed to the computations). For example, allowing factor outcomes versus requiring 0/1 indicators and data frames versus matrices.

* Separate the interface that the **modeler** uses from the code to do the computations.

* The `predict()` method should produce standardized, predictable results, generated by a standardized `type` (i.e. `type = "prob"` for class probabilities `r emojifont::emoji('smile')`). 

Rather than try to make method designers into software developers, have tools to **help them create high quality modeling packages**.

---

# Making better packages with hardhat `r I(hexes(c("hardhat")))`

Ever used `usethis::create_package()`? 

On the modeling side we have `hardhat::create_modeling_package()`.

This generates opinionated scaffolding for new modeling packages.

```{r hardhat, eval = FALSE}
library(hardhat)

create_modeling_package("~/tmp/lantern", model = "lantern_mlp")
```

The result is a "working" user interface that you can plug your implementation code into.

There is a [video demo](https://canal.uned.es/video/5dd25b9f5578f275e407dd88) that shows how to create a package in 9 steps.

# What's coming up

### ML Ops

Model Operations tools for deploying, monitoring, and updating models.

### Censored data models (a.k.a survival analysis)

These models are used to predict time-to-event data (in medicine, sports, HR, etc).

### Case weights

Tedious, but often requested. This will impact many of the tidymodels packages.
